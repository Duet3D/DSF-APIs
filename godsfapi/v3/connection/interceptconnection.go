// InterceptConnection to intercept G/M/T-codes from the control server
//
// If this connection type is used to implement new G/M/T-codes, always call the commands.Flush
// command before further actions are started and make sure it returns true> before the code is further
// processed. This step is mandatory to guarantee that the new code is executed when all other codes have finished
// and not when a code is being fed for the internal G-code buffer. If the Flush command returns false, it
// is recommended to use CancelCode() to resolve the command. DCS follows the same pattern for
// internally processed codes, too.
// If a code from a macro file is intercepted, make sure to set the commands.CodeFlags.IsFromMacro
// flag if new codes are inserted, else they will be started when the macro file(s) have finished. This step
// is obsolete if a commands.SimpleCode is inserted.
